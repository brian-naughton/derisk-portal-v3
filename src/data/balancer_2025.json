Lending protocols are prime targets for large-scale attacks with proven losses exceeding $500M across historical incidents. The 1.4x multiplier reflects the reality that each additional vulnerability vector makes every other weakness more exploitable.",

The vulnerability isn't a single catastrophic bug — it's an accumulation of tiny rounding errors across batch operations that an attacker amplifies into a liquidity drain."

The _upscaleArray() and _downscaleArray() functions introduce micro-rounding on every swap. In isolation, each rounding is negligible. But an attacker who executes thousands of precisely calibrated operations within a single flash loan can compound those micro-errors into a macro-scale extraction. The pool's invariant degrades imperceptibly with each operation — until the cumulative drift is catastrophic."

That sophistication creates a vast surface area for precision attacks. Our engine identifies 37 instances of rounding-down in financial operations, loop amplification patterns, and batch compounding — the exact combination needed to exploit the pool's mathematical assumptions."

The CIR engine's precision rule doesn't just flag rounding; it detects the structural conditions (batch ops + loops + scaling arrays) that make rounding exploitable at scale."
